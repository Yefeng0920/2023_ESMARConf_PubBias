# Publication bias workshop at the 2023 Evidence Synthesis and Meta-Analysis in R Conference ([2023 ESMARConf](https://esmarconf.org/))

## Workshop Topic
Test, adjust for, and report publication bias

## Facilitators
Dr. Yefeng Yang, Dr. Malgorzata Lagisz, and Dr. Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar

## Target Audience
The targeted audience is any researcher conducting, or planning to conduct, a meta-analysis. Publication bias testing is an essential part of a meta-analysis. Thus, every meta-analyst should know how to properly test and adjust for publication bias to ensure that their meta-analytic inferences are robust and reliable before disseminating them. 

## Requirements
There are no formal requirements for participating, but knowledge of R is desirable given that our tutorial will be based entirely on R programming language.

## Workshop Objectives
- To raise participants’ awareness on the importance of performing publication bias tests when conducting a meta-analytic synthesis
- To guide participants to select the best publication bias methods to properly test publication bias in their own meta-analysis papers
- To guide the participants to implement a publication bias test using a real-world data
- To provide participants with a hands-on tutorial (with R code), which can be directly adjusted to their own analyses

# Instructions
